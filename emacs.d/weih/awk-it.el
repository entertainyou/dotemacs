;;; Commentary:

;; AWK it! sends selected region to awk and uses yasnippet as interactive UI.
;; It supports both simplified(default) and raw AWK syntax and has support for multiple lines.

;; Simplest usage is selecting mark and point and running M-x awk-it. Default
;; field separator is space. AWK it! matches every non empty row in region ($0 !~ /^$/).

;; After invoking command buffer will change to show the following interface:

;; Data: <First line with most fields>
;; AWK pattern: <AWK code; see below; may be multiple lines without extra formatting>
;; <AWK output>

;; Example:

;; From:

;; John 26 London
;; Mark 27 Seattle 50
;; Scott 26 Sydney

;; to (ignoring the extra field in example pattern):

;; Data: Mark 27 Seattle 50
;; AWK pattern: <person name="$1" age="$2">
;;     <location>$3</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="John" age="26">
;;     <location>London</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Mark" age="27">
;;     <location>Seattle</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Scott" age="26">
;;     <location>Sydney</location>
;; </person>

;; and after expansion:

;; <person name="John" age="26">
;;     <location>London</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Mark" age="27">
;;     <location>Seattle</location>
;; </person>
;; <person name="Scott" age="26">
;;     <location>Sydney</location>
;; </person>

;; Simplified AWK code differs from regular in that it:
;;   - prints code(print "<code>")
;;   - escapes double and single quotes (latter for shell interaction)
;;   - escapes newline
;;   - concatenates fields with rest of the text

;; The previous example written in raw AWK code would be:

;; print "<person name=\"" $1 "\" age=\"" $2 "\">\n"\
;; "    <location>" $3 "</location>\n"\
;; "</person>"

;; AWK it can also be invoked with custom separator: awk-it-with-separator. Combining
;; everything the following functions are available:
;;   - awk-it
;;   - awk-it-raw
;;   - awk-it-with-separator
;;   - awk-it-raw-with-separator

;; Also AWK it! can be customized in External -> Awk it:
;;   - awk-it-load-hook; Hook that gets run after the AWK it! has been loaded
;;   - awk-it-default-separator; Default AWK field separator - if nil AWK default is used
;;   - awk-it-default-row-filter; Default AWK row filter - if nil '$0 !~ /^$/' is used
